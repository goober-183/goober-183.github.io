    <p>Little Scratch Game I made a while ago, when i used to go by awesomecat <br>
    Anyways the source code is very unreadable cause turbowarp packager, but here it is anyway: <a href="https://github.com/goober-183/CasualQuarium">source code</a><br>
    Be advised, when playing this game, your browser will lag out, ALOT (my bad for not knowing anything other than scratch when i wrote this) </p>
