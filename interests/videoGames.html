    <h2>Video Game Interests</h2>

    <h1>THIS PAGE IS A MESS, i need to fix this. eventually</h1>

    <p>I like Video Games, but which ones do I like? Here's a List in no particular Order</p>
    <h3>Team Fortress 2</h3>
    <p>I like TF2, it's a very deep game mechanic wise while being easy to pickup and play (i main soilder and heavy.)
        <br>
        Now that the bots are gone, harvest queue is really fun tbh.
    </p>
    <h3>Ratchet and Clank (series)</h3>
    <p>I love The gameplay of ratchet and clank, so i like all of the games (except for the PSP ones) but here are my
        <br>
        top 3 of all 15(?) of em! (and in order) (having a million goofy weapons accecible at any time is fun af)
    </p>
    <h4>Ratchet And Clank: Up Your Arsenal (3)</h4>
    <p>This is Definitly where the series peaked, The soundtrack aint terrible and the weapons are fun to use. The story
        <br>
        is also really funny and the multiplayer is fun as hell
    </p>
    <h4>Ratchet and Clank (2002)</h4>
    <p>This is the game that started the whole series (so expect some growing pains) but the game is hella fun to
        mess<br>
        around with if you know the movement tech. With a killer soundtrack to boot!</p>
    <h4>Ratchet And Clank: A Crack In Time</h4>
    <p>the story is good, and for the first time, I enjoyed the space sections. Also time travel is cool (i like back to
        <br>
        the future :D).
    <h3>Half-Life 2</h3>
    <p>Like this one for the same reason i like the Ratchet games, (having a million goofy weapons accecible at any time
        <br>
        is fun af). Also the soundtrack gets good at times, and hitting those revolver shots is satisfying.
