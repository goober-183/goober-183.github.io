    <h1>Hot Takes</h1>
    <h2>Firefox (or any non chromium based browser) Is better than Chrome</h2>
    <p>For whatever reason, Way too many people are using google chrome (66.6% as of October 2024 to be exact, which i
        find kinda funny)</p>
    <p>
        A. Chrome is spyware. It is well known that google snoops in on everything you do. <br>
        B. "WeLl I uSe [insert browser other than Firefox, Safari, Or Emacs (yes that works as a browser) here]" the
        problem with this statement is that most browsers and apps are based on chromium (the very app i write this in,
        Visual Studio Code, is chormium based). so google can just control web standards and get rid of anything they
        dont like (RIP Manifest V2, you will be missed). I think this is a monopoly and we shouldn't allow google to
        control the internet, because giving control of what might be the most important peice of Technology to a
        billion dolar company is stupid.

    <h2>CDs are better than Vinyl.</h2>
    <p>With the sudden realization that you don't own anything, people scrambled to their nearest reecord store to buy
        <br>
        their favorite songs on what may be the worst type of physical media when it comes to music
    </p>
    <p>
        Vinyls sucks. Compared to CDs, they have less storage capacity, and they also wear out faster. <br>
    </p>
    <p>So then why are they so popular? Honestly I have no clue. I went and asked a friend and here’s what they had to
        say:</p>

    <p>“Cd has better sound but vinyl is cooler and more fun” I then proceeded to ask them “And how exactly is it
        "cooler and more fun?” <br>
        They responded with “Flipping it over on the turn table is more fun” and “And it just gives better vibes than a
        cd” <br>
        “Flipping it over on the turn table is more fun.” Ahh yes, do I love grabbing some large plastic disk and
        flipping it like a flippin (haha) hamburger. <br>
        “better vibes.” boy do I love static and popping noises in the background of the song I want to listen to. Like
        I get it’s an “aesthetic,” but sometimes <br> I want to listen to music normally.</p>
    <p>
        This response was given to me by someone born in very late gen-z. So for some reason, when gen z read the terms
        <br>
        of service on Spotify and realized that they don’t own the music, and that it can be taken away at any time.
        <br>
        They bought vinyl?
    </p>
    <p>CDs are much better compared to vinyl. First I will talk about The fact that CDs are digital.</p>

    <p>
        The default music app on iOS is pretty awesome actually. <br>
        It’s not only for apple music. You can connect it to your Windows via iTunes or Mac <br>
        via music and store all your mp3 files on your phone, ready to be listened to, while you’re online or not.
    </p>

    <p>Now back to CDs, you can insert an audio CD into your computer’s disk drive. And if you have iTunes open, it will
        <br>
        ask you to back up your CDs, convert them to mp3, and there, your music is backed up to your computer. Then you
        <br>
        can plug your phone in, hit sync, and Boom! You can listen to your CDs on the go.
    </p>

    <p>
        You cannot do that with vinyl. As it is not digital, but instead analogue. <br>
        And considering my next point, it’s gonna be a pain not being able to back your CDs up. <br>
    </p>

    <p>DURABILITY!! Vinyls are much less durable than CDs.</p>

    <p>First of all, if you chose to buy vinyl for some reason. PLEASE WAIT A DAY TO PLAY YOUR RECORDS AGAIN. If you
        <br>
        play your record right after you played it once, it causes warping. This is because friction exists causing it
        <br>
        to heat up. And when you play it again, Warping happens.
    </p>

    <p>so yeah, vinyl sucks, buy cds instead</p>
