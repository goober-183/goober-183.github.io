    <h1>Hot Takes</h1>
    <h2>Firefox (or any non chromium based browser) Is better than Chrome</h2>
    <p>For whatever reason, Way too many people are using google chrome (66.6% as of October 2024 to be exact, which i
        find kinda funny)</p>
    <p>
        A. Chrome is spyware. It is well known that google snoops in on everything you do. <br>
        B. "WeLl I uSe [insert browser other than Firefox, Safari, Or Emacs (yes that works as a browser) here]" the
        problem with this statement is that most browsers and apps are based on chromium (the very app i write this in,
        Visual Studio Code, is chormium based). so google can just control web standards and get rid of anything they
        dont like (RIP Manifest V2, you will be missed). I think this is a monopoly and we shouldn't allow google to
        control the internet, because giving control of what might be the most important peice of Technology to a
        billion dolar company is stupid.
