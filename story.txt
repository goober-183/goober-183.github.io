SKIBIDI.EXE
By Unknown.

When I walked into the great wolf lodge, the nonchalant sigmas welcomed me. “Hawk Tuah” said one of them, “Spit on that thang!” Replied the other. “We are the sigmas” said the main one while playing Block Blast. “We are looking for the goth baddies, Wanna Join?” “Sure!” I reply, Not knowing what I was going into
	“First, you must pass your training!” Said the master. “We will start by eating breakfast.” I walk into the cafeteria, They are serving Lunchly while KSI’s “Thick Of It” plays over the loudspeakers. “I Like my cheese drippy bruh” I overhear while making my way over to where they serve the food.
	“Just give me my moooney” said the cafeteria worker. I pull out a 20 dollar bill and walk away with my “Turkey Stack ‘Ems” . It has a Feastables Chocolate bar and a Can o’ Prime. “All those electrolytes make us super sigma” said one of the elders, “I remember the 2020 covid pandemic. I was 3 then, I was really weak, When January 24th 2022 came around, I Drank a bottle of prime, I was no longer weak”
	“This place is weird” I think. After eating, I have the urge to go to the bathroom. I ask and I’m Pointed to the right direction. I run in, go into a random stall, and close the door. I turn around to see that there is a sentient head coming from out of the toilet, It Keeps singing this stupid song about “Skibidi” 
	I Feel a big one coming out, so I need to get this head out of the toilet and fast. It lunges at me and tries to take a bite, I dodge. Then I try punching back, but it gets a hold of my hand and bites it off. I curl up in a ball to defend myself, but it keeps attacking me and eventually I die.
